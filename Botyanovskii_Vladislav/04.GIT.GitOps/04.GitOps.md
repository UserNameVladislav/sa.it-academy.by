## Homework Assignment 1: Setting up a Basic GitHub Action
## Create a new public repository on GitHub.
```bash
git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/UserNameVladislav/sa.it-academy.by.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/UserNameVladislav/sa.it-academy.by.git (push)
```
## Inside the repository, create a simple Python or JavaScript script (e.g., "hello.py" or "hello.js") that prints "Hello, GitHub Actions!" to the console.

```bash
vim hello.py
cat hello.py
print("Hello  GitHub Actions!")


```
```bash
Inside the repository, create a simple Python or JavaScript script (e.g., "hello.py" or "hello.js") that prints "Hello, GitHub Actions!" to the console.
Create a new GitHub Action workflow (.github/workflows/hello.yml) that triggers on every push to the main branch.
Configure the workflow to run the script you created in step 2.
Push your changes to the repository and observe the GitHub Action run.
Homework Assignment 2: Building and Testing with GitHub Actions
Choose a programming language of your choice.
Set up a new or use an existing repository.
Create a simple program that performs a basic operation (e.g., calculation, string manipulation).
Write unit tests for your program using a testing framework appropriate for the language.
Create a GitHub Action workflow that runs the unit tests whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
Ensure the workflow reports whether the tests passed or failed.
Homework Assignment 3: Continuous Deployment with GitHub Actions (Optional)
Choose a static website or a simple web application project.
Create a GitHub repository for your project.
Set up a basic HTML/CSS or the appropriate project structure.
Create a GitHub Action workflow that automatically builds and deploys the project to GitHub Pages or another hosting service of your choice.
Configure the workflow to trigger on every push to the main branch.
Push changes to your repository and verify that the website or application is automatically deployed.
Homework Assignment 4: Customizing GitHub Actions Workflow (Optional)
Choose a project with multiple branches and environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
Set up a GitHub repository for the project.
Create a GitHub Action workflow that deploys the project to different environments based on the branch name.
Customize the workflow using conditional statements and environment-specific variables.
Test the workflow by pushing changes to various branches and verifying the deployment behavior.
Your github action files (or links to the report README.md) add to the folder 04.GitOps and create report README.md
```
